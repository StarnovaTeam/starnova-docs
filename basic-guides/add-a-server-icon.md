# ðŸ–¼ Add a Server Icon

{% hint style="success" %}
**Difficulty Level**: 2/10
{% endhint %}

A server icon is pretty easy to add, and it's what lets you stand out from the servers in the Minecraft Server List. It lets you brand your server how you like it, using your logo or an image representative of your server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Server Icons can be done in **Vanilla Minecraft** (meaning no plugins/mods/addons are necessary to utilize this in-game system for your network.
{% endhint %}

You will require SFTP (FTP/File Manager) access in order to upload and utilize a server icon. This guide will assume you have access.

**1)** First you'll need to have an image you will be utilizing for your server icon. This image needs to be 64x64 (height x width) in size, you can resize your image using an image resizer tool ([https://imageresizer.com/](https://imageresizer.com/) is the one we recommend)

**2)** Once you've downloaded and resized your image to be 64x64 in size, rename the file name to `server-icon.png`

**3)** Once the files been renamed, upload it into the [**root directory/folder**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] of your server

**4)** After uploading, validate that the file is in the directory and that the file's name is `server-icon.png`

**5)** Restart your server and your server icon should now be applied!
