# ðŸ’¡ Who are we?

## Who are we?

We're a team of people from around the globe producing unique content for people throughout the world to play and enjoy. From developers and artists to builders and designers, we try to provide premium content that seperates us from the norm. We put dedication and passion into our work so that it comes out to be the best it can be and surpass that.

That's what it says on our website, at least.

We're also gamers, cooks, and the people you meet in the line at the mall (or sometimes that one coffee shop). We understand what it feels like to be a new player and how difficult it is to keep pushing old features as a veteran one. We know how hard it is to pick something new up and to explore a new field. That's why we exist. We plan to break the normal chain of gaming networks by being something different, by providing, creating, and doing the things to go past the normal standards by creating our own version of them. While doing this, we want to be open about it, and help every future creator down the line do the same. That's why, while we make our own projects, we try to be as open and friendly to new ideas as possible. From documentation for new server owners to a striving development team for hire to help you out with your network; we know the world is based off new frontiers and we're here to help you explore them, together.
